# Steganography-project
Image steganogrpahy is a technique of encrypting and decrypting a secret message using 2 techniques namely LSB and Pixel indicator.
Pixel indicator method is used to read the pixels of the selected image and hide the text in accordance without disturbing the pixel, resolution and quality of the picture.
LSB(Least Significant Bit) to process the text to binary digits which makes it more easier to encrypt and decrypt the message.
Least significant bit substitution results in a very minor distortion of the image which is very much negligible for the human eyes.
Image Steganography is different from the other steganography in means of the color image the exisiting methods used the normal black and white pictures to encrypt and decrypt but i have used a color image for doing so.
